""QUESTION:-
You all have seen how to write loops in python. Now is the time to implement what you have learned.

Given an array A of N numbers (integers), you have to write a program which prints the sum of the elements of array A with the corresponding elements of the reverse of array A.
If array A has elements [1,2,3], then reverse of the array A will be [3,2,1] and the resultant array should be [4,4,4].

Input Format:

The first line of the input contains a number N representing the number of elements in array A.
The second line of the input contains N numbers separated by a space. (after the last elements, there is no space)

Output Format:

Print the resultant array elements separated by a space. (no space after the last element)

Example:

Input:
4
2 5 3 1

Output:
3 8 8 3

Explanation:
Here array A is [2,5,3,1] and reverse of this array is [1,3,5,2] and hence the resultant array is [3,8,8,3]\""

#SOLUTION :-

n=int(input())
a=[int(i) for i in input().split()]
ra=a[::-1]
final=[]
for i in range(n):
    x=a[i]+ra[i]
    final.append(x)
for i in range(n):
  if i!=n-1:
      print(final[i],end=" ")
  else:
      print(final[i],end="")
